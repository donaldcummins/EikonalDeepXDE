# EikonalDeepXDE

These notebooks solve simple examples of the eikonal equation in one and two dimensions using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The PINNs are fitted using the Python package [DeepXDE](https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde) with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) as a backend. An implementation of the Fast Marching Method (FMM) from the Python package [scikit-fmm](https://github.com/scikit-fmm/scikit-fmm) is used as a reference solver.
